5. **💬 Communication Issues** (6 problems)

**Total**: 29 specific problems feeding into main issue

### 📊 Flowchart Diagrams - Made Smaller but Still Detailed

#### Updated Files:

1. **`00_master_system_overview.mmd`**

    - **BEFORE**: 80+ nodes with complex nested flows
    - **AFTER**: 25 nodes with clear role-based structure
    - **Maintains**: All role functions, just streamlined

2. **`01_user_authentication_flow.mmd`**

    - **BEFORE**: 40+ nodes with detailed sub-processes
    - **AFTER**: 20 nodes focusing on main authentication path
    - **Maintains**: Registration, login, role-based access

3. **`02_chat_module_flow.mmd`**
    - **BEFORE**: 35+ nodes with detailed error handling
    - **AFTER**: 20 nodes with streamlined chat operations
    - **Maintains**: Inquiry creation, FAQ access, form access

### 🎨 Applied ERD Color Scheme Throughout

-   **Start/End**: Light blue (#e1f5fe) / Dark blue (#01579b)

-   **Error/Problem**: Light red (#ffebee) / Red (#c62828)

### 🗑️ Files Removed

**Deleted oversimplified files**:

-   `FishBone/excel_simplified.mmd`
-   `Flowchart/master_simplified.mmd`
-   `Flowchart/auth_simplified.mmd`
-   `SIMPLIFICATION_SUMMARY.md`

**Deleted old fishbone files**: All 10 individual problem files consolidated

## 📈 RESULTS

### Size Reduction While Maintaining Detail:

-   **Master Overview**: 75% fewer nodes (80→25) but keeps all role functions
-   **Authentication**: 50% fewer nodes (40→20) but maintains complete flow
-   **Chat Module**: 43% fewer nodes (35→20) but preserves all features
-   **Fishbone**: 10 files → 1 comprehensive file with 29 problems organized

### Professional Appearance:

-   Consistent ERD color scheme across all diagrams
-   Clean, readable layouts
-   Maintained detail level while reducing visual complexity
-   Better contrast and readability

## 🎯 ACHIEVED GOALS

✅ **Fishbone**: ONE comprehensive file with general problem categories
✅ **Flowcharts**: Smaller diagrams while maintaining detail and functionality  
✅ **Color Consistency**: ERD color scheme applied throughout
✅ **File Cleanup**: Removed all unwanted oversimplified versions
✅ **Documentation**: Updated READMEs to reflect changes

The diagrams are now more compact and manageable while preserving all the important details and functionality you need!
